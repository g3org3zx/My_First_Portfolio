    <h2>Discovering Front-End Development</h2>
    <h3>HTML Foundations</h3>

    <p>Hello! My name is George Kamande. I'm currently learning web development through the ALX program.</p>
    <p>This is one of my very first webpages built from scratch using just HTML.</p>
    <p>My goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer and build projects that solve real problems.</p>
    <p>Stick around and see how far I can go â€” this is just the beginning!</p>
